# Doggie Date App

Is your dog lonely? Maybe just looking for some more friends! Or maybe you want to get out and socialize with some fellow dog owners.

This app will can help you with all of the above!

You will be able to make an Owner profile and create listings for all of your dogs (yes even if you have 26). You will be able to search for other dogs and their owners so you can meet up at your local park or dog park for a fun play date. Does your dog not do well with the overly energetic types? No worries, you'll be able to filter the dogs you see by age, personality and size!

Behind the scenes this app utilizes MySQL database to hold all your pets information as well as the information needed to connect it to you; and even has a Google Maps display to show some local dog parks in the Atlanta area to make meeting up *safer* and easier for everyone.
